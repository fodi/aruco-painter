# ArUco Painter
You can use this 100% client side webapp to paint a custom ArUco marker on a rectangular grid using touch or mouse input and grab its hexadecimal representation, so you them in a custom dictionary for example.

# Usage
Open index.html (it should work from file:// without problems), or use the [online version](https://fodi.github.io/aruco-painter/).

Hopefully the rest is self-explanatory. The hexadecimal representation of the current marker is right below the grid.
